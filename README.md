## Note
There are slight rounding errors in the results of the current balance of that needs to be fixed to give a more accurate representation but for the most part, this calculator will give a good estimate of what is expected during each payment period. Expect a difference of .01 to ~.99 of a dollar difference. Graphs are in the process of being written, only the table will be displayed for the time being.
