# Loan-Amortization-Calculator
Given a total loan amount, the annual interest rate, and the term length, this calculator will compute monthly per year in the full term length of the loan of the month's payment amount, interest, cumulative interest paid, principal, cumulative principal paid, and the ending balance of the loan.

## Note
There are slight rounding errors in the results of the current balance of that needs to be fixed to give a more accurate representation but for the most part, this calculator will give a good estimate of what is expected during each payment period. Expect a difference of .01 to ~.99 of a dollar difference. Graphs are in the process of being written, only the table will be displayed for the time being.
